TODO:

1. A per-device/tty port context required to support multiple devices
on same platform.
Plan: Each BT, FM and GPS device would be a platform-device with its platform-data
mentioning which of the ST device it wants to attach itself onto.

There by each of the ST device which is also a platform device upon receiving
a st_register() would know whether the registration from BT/FM or GPS was intended for it.

2. Improve upon the way requirement of line discipline is communicated to
user-space, The current user-space application which open/installs ldisc
as and when required can be found at,
http://git.omapzoom.org/?pÿatform/hardware/ti/omap3.git;aÿob;fÿ_st/uim/uim.c;ha16c2c2b5085eb54a1bbc7096d779d7594eb11;hbìlair

3. Re-view/Re-work on the locking.

4. Re-structure to make the ldisc driver more generic for chipsets which mux
multiple connectivity (BT, FM, GPS) upon 1 TTY port.

5. Remove global references by providing a context which can be moved around the driver like the other ldisc drivers. (ldiscs tend to use tty's disc_data and platform devices use the device's driver data)

6. Step up and maintain this driver to ensure that it continues
to work.  Having the hardware for this is pretty much a
requirement.  If this does not happen, the will be removed in
the 2.6.35 kernel release.

Please send patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>.
