 *		worklist until it's empty and the state is set to

 *
 * BUTCHER	Command state which is set by the cpu callback after
 *		the cpu has went down.  Once this state is set trustee
 *		knows that there will be no new works on the worklist
 *		and once the worklist is empty it can proceed to
 *		killing idle workers.

 * RELEASE	Command state which is set by the cpu callback if the
 *		cpu down has been canceled or it has come online
 *		again.  After recognizing this state, trustee stops
 *		trying to drain or butcher and transits to DONE.
