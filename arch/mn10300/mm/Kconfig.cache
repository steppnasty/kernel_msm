	  This option determines the caching mode for the kernel.

	  Write-Back caching mode involves the all reads and writes causing
	  the affected cacheline to be read into the cache first before being
	  operated upon. Memory is not then updated by a write until the cache
	  is filled and a cacheline needs to be displaced from the cache to
	  make room. Only at that point is it written back.

	  Write-Through caching only fetches cachelines from memory on a
	  read. Writes always get written directly to memory. If the affected
	  cacheline is also in cache, it will be updated too.

	  The final option is to turn of caching entirely.
